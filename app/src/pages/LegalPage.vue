        Instead of using cookies, we may utilize local storage to enhance your
        browsing experience and store certain information on your computer or
        device. Local storage is a feature supported by modern web browsers that
        allows websites to store data locally in a user's browser. We may use
        local storage to remember user preferences, session information, or
        other data that improves your interaction with our website. This
        information is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to
        our servers or any third-party services. You can control and manage
        local storage settings through your web browser's settings or
        preferences. Please note that disabling local storage may affect the
        functionality and user experience of our website.

        When you visit our website, we may collect certain information
        automatically, including your IP address, browser type, referring
        website, pages visited, and the date and time of your visit. Our hoster
        collects the following data transmitted by your browser in so-called log
        files: IP address, the address of the previously visited website
        (referer request header), date and time of the request, time zone
        difference to Greenwich Mean Time, content of the request, HTTP status
        code, amount of data transferred, website from which the request came
        and information about the browser and operating system.

        This is necessary to display our website and to ensure stability and
        security. This corresponds to our legitimate interest within the meaning
        of Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f DSGVO. There is no tracking and we do not
        have direct access to this data, but only receive an anonymised
        statistical summary. This includes the address of the previously visited
        page, the frequency of the pages called up in each case and the number
        of unique visitors. We do not combine this data with other data.
        <br /><br />
        We use the following hoster for the provision of our website:

          States</i

        This is the recipient of your personal data. This corresponds to our
        legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f
        DSGVO in not having to maintain a server on our premises. The server is
        located in the USA. You can find more information on objection and

        You have the right to object to the processing. Whether the objection is
        successful is to be determined within the framework of a balancing of
        interests. The data will be deleted as soon as the purpose of the
        processing ceases to apply. The processing of the data provided under
        this section is not required by law or contract. The functionality of
